## Overview

This is an example or starter project for a Pac-Man-style game with the original ghost AI behaviors for Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.

Power pellets and general level design is not implemented.

[The code corresponds to a 6 part series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNwtXgWIx3rgKV7k3ZlV1S4qUsl9j8YDI) where we go over implementing each ghost AI using the State Pattern.
